# Resume Processing and Ranking System

This guide describes the process of setting up and running the Resume Processing and Ranking System. The system is designed to handle resume translation, entity extraction, summarization, and scoring against specific job descriptions.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Library
- Pandas
- NumPy
- PyPDF2

Install all required libraries using pip:

```

pip install openai pandas langdetect PyPDF2

```
## Configuration

Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```

%env OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your-OpenAI-API-Key>

```

# Update the notebook with the paths to your datasets

```

# In a Jupyter Notebook cell
directory_path = "<Path-to-your-resume-dataset>"
translated_output_directory = "<Path-to-store-translated-resumes>"
logs_directory = "<Path-to-store-logs>"

```

Execution Steps
Translation:
Run the translation functions to convert non-English resumes to English using the OpenAI API.

Entity Extraction:
Extract named entities such as job titles, skills, and education levels from the resumes.

Summarization:
Summarize the resumes to provide brief overviews using the summarization functions.

Scoring:
Score the resumes based on their relevance to a particular job description.

Report Generation:
Combine and store the results in Excel or CSV format for easy analysis and reporting.

## Running the Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook in your environment. Run each cell in the notebook to perform the tasks in sequence.


## Troubleshooting
If you run into any issues, verify that:

The OpenAI API key is set correctly.
All file paths in the script match your directory structure.
All Python libraries are installed and up-to-date.
For more detailed guidance, refer to the inline comments and documentation within the script.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute to the codebase with improvements and bug fixes. Make sure to follow the coding standards and document your changes.

```


Make sure to replace `<Your-OpenAI-API-Key>`, `<Path-to-your-resume-dataset>`, `<Path-to-store-translated-resumes>`, `<Path-to-store-logs>`, and `<Your-Script-Name>.py` with actual values relevant to your setup. Save this content in a `README.md` file at the root of your project directory.
