For example, you can extract the job title, years of experience, highest level of education, language skills, and key skills, or define any entities that you find interesting. As an additional task, you may create an Excel report that contains entities from 20-30 resumes.\r\n",

    "Make a short summary of the resume. You may choose any size you find useful. Defining the structure of the summary (adding the obligatory entities) or just getting it from LLM is up to you. The general idea is to provide an opportunity for recruiters to read it quickly and not scan 2-3 pages.\r\n",

    "Develop a mechanism to provide a ranking of the resumes for a vacancy by providing a score (float value from 0 to 1). A particular vacancy can be found at [https://www.dataart.team/vacancies](https://www.dataart.team/vacancies) (or on LinkedIn). It should work in 2 modes: calculate the score for the provided vacancy and resume, and present the top 10 candidates for the vacancy.\r\n",
